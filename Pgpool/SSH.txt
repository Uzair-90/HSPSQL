HOW SSH works?
1:Terminal computer (SSH client) -> send commands to target computer (SSH server) and output is displayed on Terminal computer (SSH client).

2:data is encrypted so no one can read.

3:SSH can be used securely over local network (private)
or internet (public).

4:First we wll open terminal to check whether the SSh is installed or not .

5:If not go to settings > Apps and Features >Add feature> SSH client > click to install. Then restart PC.

6:open run app > select services.msc >  choose openSSH server and start the service to running.

7: Go back to cmd and type ssh admin@(ip adrress), if unseccessful that means fire wall is on.

here we can connect multiple computers.

TO create own database we will use  command in psql shell:> CREATE DATABASE (name of database).

To switch database we will use command :> \c (database name).
