The Ruby code provided is testing the functionality of a simple database implemented in C through the part3.so shared object. The Ruby script 
acts as a test suite for the C database. It does this by using the Fiddle library to interact with the C functions exposed in the part3.so 
library.

The test starts by loading the C library and calling the new_table() function to create a new table. It then simulates an insert operation by 
packing the data for a row (composed of id, username, and email) into a binary format and passing it to the C function execute_statement() 
with the appropriate argument to insert the row into the table.

Next, the script performs a select operation by calling the C function execute_statement() again, this time with a 'select' argument. This 
retrieves and displays all rows from the table, effectively testing the database's ability to store and retrieve data.

Finally, the script frees the memory used by the table using the C function free_table(). The "Test completed." message is printed at the end 
to indicate successful execution of the test script.

By performing insert and select operations and ensuring no errors are encountered, the Ruby script confirms that the database functions, such 
as new_table(), execute_statement(), and free_table(), are working as expected. This simple test suite provides an initial validation that 
the C database implementation operates correctly and demonstrates the integration between Ruby and the C-based database. Further testing and 
validation may be required to thoroughly assess the database's robustness and correctness for more complex scenarios.
