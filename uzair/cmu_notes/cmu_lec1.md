```sql
select * from s union all select * from r;
```

This above query will return the union of the two tabels s and r by removing all the duplicated.

```sql
select * from s intersection select * from r;
```

The above query will return the intersection of tables s and r.

```sql
select * from s except select * from r;
```

The above query will return s-r.

```sql
select * from r cross join s; or select * from r,s;
```

The above query means (r x s).

## Natural Join:

To perform natural join in sql the syntax is as following:

```sql
select * from s natural join r;
```

### Procedure in postgresql syntax


Let us create a table first:

```sql
drop table if exists accounts;

create table accounts (
    id int generated by default as identity,
    name varchar(100) not null,
    balance dec(15,2) not null,
    primary key(id)
);

insert into accounts(name,balance)
values('Bob',10000);

insert into accounts(name,balance)
values('Alice',10000);
```

Now make a procedure:
The following example creates a stored procedure named transfer that transfers a specified amount of money from one account to another.

```sql
create or replace procedure transfer(
   sender int,
   receiver int, 
   amount dec
)
language plpgsql    
as $$
begin
    -- subtracting the amount from the sender's account 
    update accounts 
    set balance = balance - amount 
    where id = sender;

    -- adding the amount to the receiver's account
    update accounts 
    set balance = balance + amount 
    where id = receiver;

    commit;
end;$$
```
