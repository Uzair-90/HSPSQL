disk base architecture:

the dbms assumes that the primary storage location of the database is non-volatile disk.

the dbms's components manage to move data between volatile and non-volatile storage.

In volatile memory we can randomly access any data by their address and even the exact byte.
In non-volatile memory we cannot access the the memory directly but we can access the block
or the exact page which containts the data inside the block or page of memory we will access
data sequentially.
