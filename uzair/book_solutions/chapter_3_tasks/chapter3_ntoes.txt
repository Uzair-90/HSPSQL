read page number 40 of the book there will be an example read the example carefully and you will see some important things about conversion specifiers.

Some of the most common used conversion specifiers are discussed below:

1) %d this will the variable with minimum amount of space (means least amount of characters).

2) %5d  this will display the variable with a minimum of 5 characters.

3) %-5d this will display the variable with a minimum of 5 characters but left justified.

4) %5.3d this will display the variable with a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 characters.

5) %10.3f this will display the variable with a fix size of 10 characters and three points after the decimal place.

6) %10.3e this will display the variable in exponential form with 10 characters overall and three places after the decimal point.

example illustration of 6:
	
		float x = 839.21f;
		printf("%10.3e",x);

	RESULT:

		--------8.392e+02

7) %10g this will display the variable in either decimal or exponential form using 10 characters overall.

Escape Sequence:
	\n
	\t
	\a
This type of occurance is known as escape sequence whether you want to go on next line or want a tab or something like that.

(\") this escape sequence is used when you want to print print double quotes as it as in the output.

Example:
 			"\"Hello World!\""
RESULT:
			"Hello World!"

To print a \ operator as a string you must put it twice because a single will be considered as escape sequence like:

printf("\");
 
 The above line will not print anything or will cause an error.

 You must write something like:

printf("\\");

This will print:
	\

Scanf:

Scanf is used for input purpose it is a sequence matching function it takes the input match it with the provided datatype and ignore the white and blank spaces while reading the input from the user-end.

While reading an integer the function first lookup for a plus or minus sign and after that it look for a digit and keep looking until it finds a nondigit.

While reading a float it first look for + or - sign and then keep looking for digits and a decimal point or exponential sign.

%f,%e or %g can be used interchangebally for float reading in scanf.

Inputer termination:

consider the following line of code:

scanf("%d,%d",&i,&j);

in the above line of code scanf will put i into %d and then it will looking for a comma but if doesn't find any comma it will terminate the function without any furthure looking.

Fractions using scanf:

If the user have to input a fraction we don't need to take numerator or denomirator seperately we can take both of them at once in scanf like below:


int numerator = 0;
int denumerator = 0;
printf("Enter the fraction: ");
scanf("%d/%d",&numerator,&denumerator);

this will take the user input at once as a fraction.
